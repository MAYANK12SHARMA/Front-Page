    question: "What is the NextGen ML Platform?",
    answer:
      "NextGen is an all-in-one no-code Machine Learning platform that allows users to explore data, build models, and visualize insights without writing any code. It integrates Data Visualization, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning studios into a seamless workflow.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who can use the NextGen platform?",
    answer:
      "The platform is designed for both technical and non-technical users—students, analysts, researchers, or professionals. Anyone can upload datasets (CSV, XLS, etc.) and start analyzing, training, and deploying models with just a few clicks.",
  },
  {
    question: "What features does the Data Visualization Studio offer?",
    answer:
      "The Data Visualization Studio provides automatic insights through interactive dashboards, customizable visualizations like scatter plots, heatmaps, and box plots, and report generation in PDF or HTML formats. Users can also create custom plots using the PlotWizard module.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I train Machine Learning models on this platform?",
    answer:
      "Yes, the ML Studio offers a full suite for model training, including preprocessing, feature selection, model selection (classification & regression), evaluation metrics, and visualization of results—all in a no-code environment.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Deep Learning supported in NextGen?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely! The Deep Learning Studio enables users to build and train neural networks for image, text, and tabular data tasks. It supports multiple architectures and provides model performance analytics.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the platform handle my data?",
    answer:
      "NextGen ensures your data is handled securely. Uploaded data is stored temporarily for processing and is not shared or reused. Reports and models can be downloaded locally for privacy and security.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I download the plots and reports?",
    answer:
      "Yes. All plots created using the PlotWizard and all generated reports can be downloaded in both image and document formats. This makes it easy to include insights in your presentations or documentation.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need programming knowledge to use NextGen?",
    answer:
      "No coding skills are required. The entire platform is built on a visual, user-friendly interface using Streamlit, allowing you to build ML pipelines and data visualizations without writing a single line of code.",
  },
